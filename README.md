# NFT project : KEMAR

# public project presentation

This project is to pay tribute to kemar, a personality who marked generations.
The goal of this project wass to create a NFT's collection of all characters that came out of Kemar's imagination and came to life through his various videos.
There is a total of 12 NFT in the collection, each of them have different value and they have specificity. 
Kemar's characters are, for the fans, differentiable and unique icons. That's why the collection was created, to give the fans the possibility to be even closer to their idols through this notion of virtual property.

We can notice that Paco Lopez appeared 2 times because of his personality and only true fans of Kemar are knowing why.T his character has 2 personalities in one so that's why 2 Paco Lopez exist in this collection.

The second remarkable feature of the collection is the presence of 3 NFT's that seem to be the same but with different names, in fact the DJ Santos character is the one who created the song to celebrate Kemar's million subscribers on youtube. 
The names of these three NFTs are DJ SANTOS, DJ SANTOSs and Bosseti.
The explanation for the name Bosseti behind one of the NFT's representing DJ Santos is that the character of DJ Santos could be none other than Bosseti himself and this again true Kemar fans will not let this detail slip by them.
