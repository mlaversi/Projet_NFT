# Sample Hardhat Project


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.


Try running some of the following tasks:


```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts

# NFT project : KEMAR


# public project presentation

Here's the link : https://testnets.opensea.io/assets/mumbai/0xdf518984aabbff90d9ac4e2101633c2e8cb4d606/1


This project is to pay tribute to kemar, a personality who marked generations.
The goal of this project wass to create a NFT's collection of all characters that came out of Kemar's imagination and came to life through his various videos.
There is a total of 12 NFT in the collection, each of them have different value and they have specificity. 
Kemar's characters are, for the fans, differentiable and unique icons. That's why the collection was created, to give the fans the possibility to be even closer to their idols through this notion of virtual property.


We can notice that Paco Lopez appeared 2 times because of his personality and only true fans of Kemar are knowing why.T his character has 2 personalities in one so that's why 2 Paco Lopez exist in this collection.


The second remarkable feature of the collection is the presence of 3 NFT's that seem to be the same but with different names, in fact the DJ Santos character is the one who created the song to celebrate Kemar's million subscribers on youtube. 
The names of these three NFTs are DJ SANTOS, DJ SANTOSs and Bosseti.
The explanation for the name Bosseti behind one of the NFT's representing DJ Santos is that the character of DJ Santos could be none other than Bosseti himself and this again true Kemar fans will not let this detail slip by them.




# technical project presentation




About the technical part of this project, we used some technologies and notions:
* installing hardhat : an ethereum development environment, it gave us the possibility to run solidity locally and deploy our NFTs easily.
* creation and usage of a smart contract code :  the smart contract is a type of Ethereum account with a balance and can be the target of transactions, that’s why we have created ones, we can also say that the smart contract is simply a program that runs on the Ethereum blockchain.
* usage of metamask : to interact with the Ethereum blockchain, It’s a software cryptocurrency wallet and gives the ability to users to access their Etheureum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app.
* NFT’s was uploaded to PINATA 
* NFT’s are visible on OPENSEA
